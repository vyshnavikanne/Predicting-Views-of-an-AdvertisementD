# Predicting-Views-of-an-AdvertisementD
Developed a model to estimate the number of views an advertisement will receive.

Abstract:

This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate the number of views an advertisement will receive. By analyzing historical data of advertisements, including factors such as target audience, ad content, placement, duration, and timing, machine learning algorithms are employed to identify patterns that influence viewership. The model is designed to provide businesses with insights into expected ad performance, enabling them to optimize marketing strategies. This approach enhances decision-making, reduces advertising costs, and improves audience engagement through more effective ad placement and content personalization.
